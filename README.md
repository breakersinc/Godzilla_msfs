Imagine yourself flying in the storm with poor visibility and suddenly discover the lightning silhouette of the King of the Monsters.
Stop imagining it. Now you can feel it.

G O D Z I L L A A A ! !

Not located in Tokyo because TOKIO IS NOT PHOTOGRAMMETRY MESHED in FS2020. :((

My 1st try of Fictional scenery. If ANYONE likes it, I Will do KING KONG up the Empire State.
Or the Burj Khalifa?
